						<h1>Google IT Support</h1>
						<p>
							This specialization is combination of five courses. I completed this specialization few months ago. I realized how much my skills have developed. I dive into the world of information technology from this course. I learn about how to utilize common problem-solving methodologies and soft skills in an Information Technology setting. I have been get a very deep knowledge about TCP/IP protocols, understand how system processes work and how to manage them, work with system logs and remote connection tools, utilize best practices for choosing hardware, vendors, and services , backup data and know how to recover  IT infrastructure in the case of a disaster, how various encryption algorithms and techniques work as well as their benefits and limitations, &  the difference between authentication and authorization.
